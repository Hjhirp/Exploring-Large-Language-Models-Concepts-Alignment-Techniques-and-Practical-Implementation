# Text Summarization with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Alignment Techniques

Welcome to the repository for **Text Summarization using Large Language Models (LLMs)**, showcasing techniques such as **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** and **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**. This project accompanies my Medium blog, where I explain these concepts and provide a practical implementation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook (`implementation-of-llm-using-rlhf-for-summarization.ipynb`)** that demonstrates text summarization using a pre-trained LLM. The notebook includes data preparation, model training, and fine-tuning using advanced alignment techniques, making it a great resource for anyone interested in LLM applications for summarization.

## 📚 Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: Steps to clean and prepare datasets for effective model training.
- **Model Training**: Detailed process to train a language model for text summarization.
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning**: Leverage **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** and **Quantized LoRA (QLoRA)** to efficiently fine-tune large models.
- **LLM Alignment**: Implement **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** to align model outputs with human preferences.
